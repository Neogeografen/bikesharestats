Bike Share Bot
=========
Is your bike sharing site giving you a 404? Find here the latest updated cache of a bike sharing network.

This repo contains almost real time maps of all bike sharing networks supported in the [CityBikes API] [1]. Stats are pushed to the repo every 5 minutes.

The code for the bot itself is in [git-bikeshare-bot](https://github.com/eskerda/git-bikeshare-bot)

Click [here] [2] for a full list of all supported networks, or just click any geojson file to see them on a map. For example, to access the Citi Bike NYC bike share, you would go to [citibikenyc.geojson](citibikenyc.geojson)

If you are really into this, you'll also like our [project] [3].

Have fun!
